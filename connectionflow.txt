Create uninterrupted screen with screen Linux command:
Create screen: Screen -S <session_name> → Example: screen -S thesis_experiment
Resume: Screen -r
List screens: screen -ls
Detach: Ctrl+a d (NB: Ctrl+c is interrupt whole code process if you wanna stop!) Ctrl-a+d is quit SSH
Kill: screen -X -S <session_id> quit Create: Screen -S <session_name> 

Run code:  xvfb-run -a -s "-screen 0 1280x1024x24" -- python main.py 
Flow: create screen → run xvfb code → detach → ctrl+d to quit ssh (ctrl+c to quit code)
